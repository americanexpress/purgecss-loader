## ü§π‚Äç Usage

```
npm install -D @americanexpress/purgecss-loader
```

## üéõÔ∏è API

### Configure as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: {...},
  output: {...},
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
            options: {
              modules: true,
              localIdentName: '[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]',
            },
          },
          {
            loader: '@americanexpress/purgecss-loader',
            options: {
              paths: [path.join(somePath, 'src/**/*.{js,jsx}')],
              whitelistPatternsChildren: [/:global$/],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

You should use this with the [`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader)
as seen above. However, it is not required that you use CSS modules. That is in
the example to express this loader's compatibility.
